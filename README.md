# Map Coordinate Selector

This project allows users to draw coordinates on a map and fetches the location details of the selected area. The user can interactively select an area on the map, and the application retrieves and displays the corresponding location details.

## Features

- Interactive map interface to draw and select areas.
- Fetches and displays the location details of the selected area.
- Responsive design for a seamless user experience on different devices.
- Simple implementation with HTML and JavaScript.

## Requirements

- A modern web browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.).
- Internet connection for accessing the map APIs.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/stackmasteraliza/map-coordinate-selector.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd map-coordinate-selector
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser:
   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```
   Alternatively, you can use a local server for better performance.

## Usage

1. Open the application in your browser.
2. Use the map interface to draw an area (e.g., rectangle, polygon, etc.).
3. Once the area is selected, click the "Get Location" button.
4. The application will fetch and display the details of the selected area (e.g., coordinates, address, etc.).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the application interface.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity and fetching data using APIs.
- **Map API**: (e.g., Google Maps, Leaflet.js, or Mapbox) for rendering the map and handling coordinate selections.

## Future Enhancements

- Add the ability to save the selected coordinates for future reference.
- Integrate a backend service to store and manage user selections.
- Display additional information about the selected area, such as population or landmarks.
